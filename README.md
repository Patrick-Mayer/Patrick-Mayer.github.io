This is my personal website for professional purposes.








Changelog:
*Got rid of 'A' DNS record, so now the only 4 'A' records are the github hosting ones.
*CNAME name was changed from "subdomain" to "patrick-mayer".

Where I left off:
"Managing a custom domain" github article, section "configuring apex domain", step 6 open git bash.
